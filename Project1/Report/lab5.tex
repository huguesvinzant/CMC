  you in the implementation, and can be deleted whenever the
  corresponding code has been implemented correctly.}


% \textit{In this exercise, you will explore the different modeling

%   by a pair of antagonist spring like muscles and then extend the
%   model by adding dampers to it. These only represent the passive
%   dynamics observed in a real musculoskeletal system. To make the

\section*{Exercise 1 : Hill muscle model}
\label{sec:question-2}

Previous week you explored the role of different passive components
and the effects of its parameters on the system. In this exercise, we
try to understand the contractile or the active element of the hill
muscle model. The components of the hill muscle are described in
figure \ref{fig:hill_muscle}. The equations used to model the hill
muscle can be found in the pdf \fileref{HillMuscleEquations.pdf}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering \includegraphics[scale=2.5]{figures/hill_muscle}
  \caption{Hill muscle model}
  \label{fig:hill_muscle}
\end{figure}

Where,

\begin{itemize}
\item $PE$ : Parallel element (Prevents muscle from over stretching)
\item $BE$ : Muscle Belly (Prevents muscle from collapsing on itself)
\item $SE$ : Series element or the muscle tendon element
\item $CE$ : Contractile Element or the active element
\item $l_{opt}$ : Muscle optimal fiber length
\item $l_{slack}$ : Muscle tendon slack length
\item $l_{CE}$ : Contractile element length
\item $l_{MTC}$ : Muscle Tendon Complex length
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Muscle Force-Length Relationship}
\label{sec:muscle-force-length}
In this exercise you will explore the relation between the length and
velocity of the muscle. In order to do this we replicate the set-up
show in figure \ref{fig:muscle-setup}.Here the length of the muscle is
held constant by attaching it's tendon to two fixed points. While
applying a constant stimulation, observing the force produced will
give the relationship between muscle contractile element length and
force.
\subsection*{1.a For a given stimulation, explore the relationship
  between active and passive muscle forces and the length of the
  contractile element.  Plot the force-length relationship curve.
  Discuss the different regions in the plot. Use the
  \fileref{isometric\_muscle\_system.py::IsometricMuscleSystem} instance
  to setup your experiment in \fileref{exercise1.py}}

\subsection*{1.b In (1.a), you explored the muscle force-length
  relationship for a given stimulation. What happens to the
  relationship when the stimulation is varied between [0 - 1]? Support
  your response with one plot showing the different force-length
  relationship curves.}


\subsection*{1.c Describe how the fiber length ($l_{opt}$) influences
  the force-length curve.  (Compare a muscle comprised of short muscle
  fibers to a muscle comprised on long muscle fibers.). To change the
  parameter you can use
  \fileref{system\_parameters.py::MuscleParameters} before
  instantiating the muscle. No more than two plots are required. }


\subsection*{Muscle Velocity-Tension Relationship}
In this exercise you will explore the relation between the force and
velocity of the muscle. In order to do this we replicate the set-up
show in figure \ref{fig:muscle-setup}. Here the length of the muscle
is allowed to vary by attaching one of its end to a fixed point and
the other to a variable external load. While applying a constant load
initially and holding the muscle at constant length, a quick release
is performed to let the muscle contract and pull the weight. The
maximum velocity during this quick release will give us the
relationship between muscle contractile velocity and the force.


\corr{Note} : Since the velocity changes sign and you need to compute the maximum
velocity accordingly by checking if the muscle was stretched or compressed
at the end of the experiment.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
 V_{ce} = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
      max(v_{ce}(t)) & l_{mtc} < (l_{opt} + l_{slack}) \\
      min(v_{ce}(t)) & else \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

\subsection*{1.d For a stimulation of 1.0 and starting at optimal
  muscle length, explore the relationship between contractile element
  velocity and external load. Plot the Velocity-Tension relationship
  curve. Include shortening and lengthening regions. Use the
  \fileref{isotonic\_muscle\_system.py::IsotonicMuscleSystem} instance
  to setup your experiment in \fileref{exercise1.py}}

\subsection*{1.e For the muscle force-velocity relationship, why is
  the lengthening force greater than the force output during
  shortening? No plots necessary}


\subsection*{1.f What happens to the force-velocity relationship
  when the stimulation is varied between [0 - 1]? Support your
  response with one plot showing the different force-velocity
  relationship curves.  }
