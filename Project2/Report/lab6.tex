\section*{Exercise 2 : Pendulum model with Muscles}
\label{sec:question-1}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering \includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figures/pendulum_muscles.pdf}
  \caption{Pendulum with Antagonist Hill Muscles}
  \label{fig:p_muscles}
\end{figure}

The system is comprised of a physical pendulum described by equation
\ref{eq:pendulum} and a pair of antagonist muscles \textbf{M1} and
\textbf{M2}. Muscle \textbf{M1} extends the pendulum ($\theta$
increases) and Muscle \textbf{M2} flexes the muscle ($\theta$
decreases).

Consider the system only for the pendulum range $\theta$ =
$[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pendulum}
  I\ddot{\theta} = -0.5 \cdot m \cdot g \cdot L \cdot sin(\theta)
\end{equation}

Where,

\begin{itemize}
\item $I$ - Pendulum inertia about the pendulum pivot joint
  [$kg \cdot m^2$]
\item $\theta$ - Pendulum angular position with the vertical [$rad$]
\item $\ddot{\theta}$ - Pendulum angular acceleration
  [$rad \cdot s^{-2}$]
\item $m$ - Pendulum mass [$kg$]
\item $g$ - System gravity [$m \cdot s^{-2}$]
\item $L$ - Length of the pendulum [$m$]
\end{itemize}

Each muscle is modelled using the Hill-type equations that you are now
familiar with.  Muscles have two attachment points, one at the origin
and the other at the insertion point.  The origin points are denoted
by $O_{1,2}$ and the insertion points by $I_{1,2}$. The two points of
attachment dictate how the length of the muscle changes with respect
to the change in position of the pendulum.

The active and passive forces produced by the muscle are transmitted
to the pendulum via the tendons. In order to apply this force on to
the pendulum, we need to compute the moment based on the attachments
of the muscle.

Using the laws of sines and cosines, we can derive the length of
muscle and moment arm as below. The reference to the paper can be
found here
\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5323435}{\corr{Reference}},

\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:2}
  L_1 = \sqrt[2]{a_{1}^2 + a_{2}^2 + 2 \cdot a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \sin(\theta)} \\
  h_1 = \frac{a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \cos(\theta)}{L_1}
\end{eqnarray}

Where,

\begin{itemize}
\item $L_1$ : Length of muscle 1
\item $a_1$ : Distance between muscle 1 origin and pendulum origin
  ($|O_1C|$)
\item $a_2$ : Distance between muscle 1 insertion and pendulum origin
  ($|I_1C|$)
\item $h_1$ : Moment arm of the muscle
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/pendulum_muscles_force_length.pdf}
  \caption[force_length]{Computation of muscle length and moment arm}
  \label{fig:pendulum_muscles_force_length}
\end{figure}

Equation \ref{eq:2} can be extended to the Muscle 2 in similar
way. Thus, the final torque applied by the muscle on to the pendulum
is given by,

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  \tau = F \cdot h
\end{equation}

Where,

\begin{itemize}
\item $\tau$ : Torque [$N \cdot m$]
\item $F$ : Muscle Tendon Force [$N$]
\item $h$ : Muscle Moment Arm [$m$]

\end{itemize}

In this exercise, the following states of the system are integrated
over time,

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  X = \begin{bmatrix}
    \theta & \dot{\theta} & A_1 & l_{CE1} & A_2 & l_{CE2}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Where,

\begin{itemize}
\item $\theta$ : Angular position of the pendulum [rad]
\item $\dot{\theta}$ : Angular velocity of the pendulum [rad/s]
\item $A_1$ : Activation of muscle 1 with a range between [0, 1].  0
  corresponds to no stimulation and 1 corresponds to maximal
  stimulation.
\item $l_{CE1}$ : Length of contracticle element of muscle 1
\item $A_2$ : Activation of muscle 2 with a range between [0, 1].  0
  corresponds to no stimulation and 1 corresponds to maximal
  stimulation.
\item $l_{CE2}$ : Length of contracticle element of muscle 2
\end{itemize}

To complete this exercise you will make use of the following files,
\fileref{exercise2.py}, \fileref{system\_parameters.py},
\fileref{muscle.py}, \fileref{system.py}, \fileref{pendulum\_system.py},
\fileref{muscle\_system.py}, \fileref{system\_simulation.py} %

\label{sec:questions}

\subsection*{2a. For a given set of attachment points, compute and
  plot the muscle length and moment arm as a function of $\theta$
  between $[-\pi/4, \pi/4]$ using equations in \corr{eqn:\ref{eq:2}}
  and discuss how it influences the pendulum resting position and the
  torques muscles can apply at different joint angles. You are free to implement
this code by yourself as it does not have any other dependencies.}
\label{sec:2a}


\subsection*{2b. Using simple activation wave forms (example : sine or
  square waves) applied to muscles (use
  \fileref{system\_simulation.py::add\_muscle\_activations} method in
  \fileref{exercise2.py}), try to obtain a limit cycle behavior for
  the pendulum. Use relevant plots to prove the limit cycle behavior.
  Explain and show the activations wave forms you used. Use
  \newline \fileref{pendulum\_system.py::PendulumSystem::pendulum\_system} function to perturb the model.}
\label{sec:2c}


\subsection*{2c. Show the relationship between stimulation
  frequency and amplitude with the resulting pendulum's behavior.}

\section*{Exercise 3 : Neural network driven pendulum model with
  muscles}
\label{sec:neur-netw-driv}

In this exercise, the goal is to drive the above system
\ref{fig:p_muscles} with a symmetric four-neuron oscillator
network. The network is based on Brown's half-center model with
fatigue mechanism. Here we use the leaky-integrate and fire neurons
for modelling the network. Figure \ref{fig:p_muscles_neurons} shows
the network structure and the complete system.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=1.5]{figures/pendulum_muscles_neurons.pdf}
  \caption{Pendulum with Antagonist Hill Muscles Driven Half Center
    Neural Network.}
  \label{fig:p_muscles_neurons}
\end{figure}

Since each leaky-integrate and fire neuron comprises of one first
order differential equation, the states to be integrated now increases
by four(one state per neuron). The states are,


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  X = \begin{bmatrix}
    \theta & \dot{\theta} & A_1 & l_{CE1} & A_2 & l_{CE2} & m_1 & m_2 & m_3 & m_4
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

Where,

\begin{itemize}
\item $m_1$ : Membrane potential of neuron 1
\item $m_2$ : Membrane potential of neuron 2
\item $m_3$ : Membrane potential of neuron 3
\item $m_4$ : Membrane potential of neuron 4
\end{itemize}

To complete this exercise, additionally you will have to use
\fileref{neural\_system.py} and \fileref{exercise3.py}

\subsection*{3a. Find a set of weights for the neural network that
  produces oscillations to drive the pendulum into a limit cycle
  behavior. Plot the output of the network and the phase plot of
the pendulum}
\label{sec:4a}


\subsection*{3b. As seen in the course, apply an external drive to the
  individual neurons and explain how the system is affected. Show
  plots for low [0] and high [1] external drives. To add external
  drive to the network you can use the method \\
  \fileref{system\_simulation.py::add\_external\_inputs\_to\_network} }
\label{sec:4c}


\subsection*{3c. [Open Question] What are the limitations of the half
  center model in producing alternating patterns to control the
  pendulum? What would be the effect of sensory feedback on this
  model? (No plots required)}
